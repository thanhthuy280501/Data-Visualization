#1. read the titanic.csv file and assign it to a data frame called df.
import pandas as pd
file_path = '/content/drive/MyDrive/DATA/titanic.csv'
df = pd.read_csv(file_path)
display(df.head())

#2. Use the summary function to get a statistical summary of data frame.
# In pandas, use .describe() for this.
print("--- Statistical Summary ---")
display(df.describe())
# Columns with meaningful statistical summaries (mean/median) are numerical ones like Age, SibSp, Parch, and Fare.

#3. Assign the rows that don't have NA value for the Age column from df to df2.
df2 = df[df['Age'].notna()]
print(f"Rows in df2 (non-NA Age): {len(df2)}")

#4. Assign those rows which have Survived passenger under the age of 30 to another data frame called younger.
younger = df2[(df2['Survived'] == 1) & (df2['Age'] < 30)]
print(f"Number of survivors under 30: {len(younger)}")
display(younger.head())

#5. Assign those rows which have Survived passengers at the age of 30 and above to another data frame called older.
older = df2[(df2['Survived'] == 1) & (df2['Age'] >= 30)]
print(f"Number of survivors 30 and older: {len(older)}")
display(older.head())
